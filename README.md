[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/793990418.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17733769)


 This is a Auxiliary Field Quantum Monte Carlo (AFQMC) that is developed at the University of Vienna and Vienna Ab Initio Simulation Package (VASP).

 Code has been written by Sajad Bazrafshan, Amir Taheridehkordi, Martin Schlipf, Zoran Sukurma, Moritz Humer, and Georg Kresse. 

 It supports execution with NumPy, CuPy, and JAX, enabling computation on both CPUs and GPUs, and it works in single and double precision.
